/**
 * A {@link ServiceTracker} extension that simplifies its usage.
 * <p>
 * It enhances {@code ServiceTracker} by adding:
 * <ul>
 * <li>Multiple event listeners for service add/remove events
 * <li>Simpler event callbacks that do not need to deal with getting/ungetting
 *     services, calling super methods or returning service objects
 * <li>Generics support, which means the callback and {@code getList()} methods
 *     are type-safe and require no casting
 * <li>A {@link #getAllServices()} method which returns all currently tracked services;
 *     Unlike {@link ServiceTracker#getServices()}, if it is called from within a service
 *     {@link SimpleServiceTrackerListener#added added} event handler, the returned list
 *     will include the newly added service (this is the source of several bugs when using
 *     the original {@code getServices()})
 * </ul>
 *
 * @param <T> the service interface type
